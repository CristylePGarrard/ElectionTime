                    <h4>Sex Education Instruction Amendments</h4>
                    <div class="small">
                        <p>This bill removes “human sexuality” from the definition of sex education instruction in Utah schools. While seemingly minor, this change has significant implications. By removing “human sexuality” from the list of topics requiring parental consent, the bill creates confusion about what can be taught and whether LGBTQ identities can be discussed in educational settings. This bill was introduced so late in the session that it was clear it would not advance.</p>

                    <div class="small">
                        <p>This bill would prevent law enforcement and child welfare professionals from protecting transgender youth when parents refuse to acknowledge their gender identity. The bill also shields parents from consideration of such refusal during custody proceedings, potentially leaving children without vital support during critical developmental periods.

                        <p>This bill is another attempt to target First Amendment protected expressive conduct. Last year, the legislature introduced and passed legislation targeting lewd behavior towards minors. That legislation has only been in effect since May 2024, and yet now HB 401 is being advanced to expand upon that prior legislation. This year’s bill includes vague language that is constitutionally problematic and could target protected First Amendment activity. The bill language is borrowed from a Tennessee statute that was introduced to prohibit drag performances. We lobbied key lawmakers to ensure this bill did not move through the legislative process.</p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Equality Utah primarily focuses our resources on bills directly impacting the LGBTQ community, occasionally bills so aggressively impinge on the broader principles of democracy that it becomes important for us to unite with other community partners to voice collective opposition. HB 300 presents one of those circumstances. As first introduced, the bill essentially ended vote-by-mail in Utah. The bill was amended to largely preserve vote by mail, although as passed it still contains various unnecessary barriers to voter participation. Because the bill has a delayed implementation date of 2029, there is still time for future positive amendments in upcoming legislative sessions.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill initially expanded the reach of state anti-discrimination protections by reducing the minimum employee threshold from 15 to 5 workers. Under current law, only businesses with 15 or more employees must comply with state anti-discrimination regulations. By lowering this threshold to 5 employees, the bill would extend these important workplace protections to employees of smaller businesses. In the Senate committee hearing, language regarding sexual harassment was added, but the committee members failed to lower the threshold of employees below 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill modifies HB 257 from the 2024 Legislative Session, which restricted access to privacy spaces such as restrooms and locker rooms, by adding higher education student housing as a privacy space. Under the substitute bill adopted in committee, sex-segregated student housing on Utah’s public college campuses is now restricted based on birth-sex, with the original exceptions (birth certificate changes and primary sex characteristic surgery) being eliminated. The bill maintains provisions allowing universities to offer co-ed, multigender dorm facilities.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prohibits the Department of Corrections from allowing an inmate to initiate gender transition by means of cross-sex hormones, primary or secondary sex characteristic surgical procedures or puberty blockers. This bill does not prevent inmates currently receiving gender-affirming care from continuing the care. The bill also restricts placement in secure care and youth rooms by gender assigned at birth. However, we understand the current practice in the youth criminal justice system is to provide individual rooms to youth offenders.&nbsp;</span></p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill prevents disciplinary action from being taken against a Utah public school teacher for using a name or pronoun other than that requested by the student, so long as done in good faith, or at the request of the student’s parents. The bill also limits disciplinary action from being taken against a government employee for using a name or pronoun other than that requested by another employee, so long as done in good faith or because of a sincerely held religious or moral belief. We worked closely with lawmakers in the House to amend the bill to incorporate anti-discrimination language from the Utah Compromise. We continued to assert that even the amended bill was unnecessary and worked with lawmakers to kill the bill in a Senate committee hearing.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <div class="small">
                        <p>This bill prohibits cities, counties, and public schools from displaying Pride and other community flags. We worked with the bill’s sponsor to secure amendments that protect the First Amendment rights of teachers and students, ensuring they can continue to wear rainbow stickers, pins, and patches in the classroom. Additionally, we advocated for language that safeguards students, including LGBTQ youth, from discrimination. We also successfully pushed for the removal of a provision that would have allowed parents to sue teachers over flags displayed in classrooms. However, the bill still includes restrictions on state and local governments flying certain flags, which raises concerns about its constitutional limitations.</p>
